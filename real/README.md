# Readme for Rush hour 
## Introduction
This project implements a variety of alogrithms to solve the popular sliding puzzle game Rush Hour. The game involves sliding cars in a grid to clear a path for the red car to escape to the right.

## Requirements
The following packages are required to run the code:
- numpy
- Queue
- Ast
- copy 
- typing 
- dataclasses

## The code consists of seven main classes:

Board class to represent the state of the game and perform actions such as updating the board and checking if the red car has escaped
Car class which creates the car object 
There are also classes for each alogirthm: 
- Random 
- Greedy
- Breadth 
- depth  
- Best first

## Usage
To run the code follow the format in the command line 
python main.py (Alogrithm name) (board number) 

Alogirthm names:
- RandomAlgorithm
- Greedy
- Breadth
- ID
- Astar

## Conclusion
The  algorithms and heurstiks combined produce solutions for most of the given bords.
